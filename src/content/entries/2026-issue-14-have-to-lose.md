In winter, I play like I'll take myself away.\
Other seasons are not for this. I run\
My hands to take in bones, and breaths, and beats.\
I'm called a klepto.

Drinkers watch me take\
From their tall cups. I gain more grain and steam.\
I can't take apart the ings.\
I run within the ings

In the flood season. My play is taken apart\
By the grain. I watch\
Kleptos take my hands. I offer them\
Cups of steamed winter.

Drinkers can't take away\
My bones, and breaths, and beats. I call myself in.

Every offer is seasonal.

Bones ran down.\
Breaths taken.\
Only ares beat. Hand cupped\
Floods steam.

I call takers\
Watchers. Play again.

Take a low lie in the grain.\
I'm inging.
