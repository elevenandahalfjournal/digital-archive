Mornings are slow and gentle.\
The sun shines its warm, dewy glow onto our sleepy faces.\
The city is bustling with the hum of humanity in full effect.\
Apartments filled with people, shuffling through their daily rituals.\
Quiet repetitions that give shape to each morning.

For many, that ritual unfolds as a delicate art.\
A dance that perpetuates self-care: a skincare routine.\
Rows of cleansers and serums line the medicine cabinet shelves.\
Overflowing into every corner of the bathroom,\
Cluttered items become reflections of overconsumption disguised as self-care.

We cleanse, exfoliate, and moisturize, maintaining a calm relationship with our reflection.\
The act becomes a love language.\
A practice that whispers echoes of devotion.\
Small circles, quiet breaths, gentle pauses.\
Each motion a small vow to remain gentle with myself.

My hands move with intention, tracing light across skin.\
Cleansing what was, preparing for what's next.\
Staring at my vanity, I meet myself again:\
Not perfected, but alive, radiant in the quiet language of care.

Beneath that natural glow, I'm not chasing a standard of beauty but a kind of tranquility.\
Resting, for a moment, in the soft stillness of simply existing.
