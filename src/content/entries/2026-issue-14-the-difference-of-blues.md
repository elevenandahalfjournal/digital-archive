Who are you from what I know,\
Is change the thing that follows?\
Do the blue jays sing\
While you're away,\
Or is every day different from tomorrow?\
I offer a thing\
That burns aflame,\
Is it desire or some unanswered call?\
Can you hear the knocking,\
Do you hear the ring?\
Do you imagine what it's like,\
What it all could be?\
Or should I just die,\
A blue feather in hand,\
And nothing left to give?
