She doesn't remember\
the last time she was a kid.

A kid\
no thought, just feeling.\
Not begging for love,\
not chasing security,\
not trying to survive.

But still,\
she was a kid.\
A kid with feelings.

She wanted to die\
at such a young age,\
but even the thought of dying tired her\
after countless times.

Slowly,\
she has grown.

Now she knows\
she might never get to be a kid.\
She's grown into a young adult\
one who fully understands\
that dying is not even an option.

And she can feel the kid\
leaving her\
piece by piece.

Soon,\
there will be no kid left\
in her world.

So she decided\
to hold a funeral for her\
for the little kid,\
to remember\
the one who held on for so long,\
a small gift\
for the one who was brave.

Kiss goodbye.
