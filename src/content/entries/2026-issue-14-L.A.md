we left and buried you,\
the sun remains in your grave\
you starve artists and feed them\
pilates and real estate\
set-dressed with palm trees\
and expensive craft service\
method acting as an authenti-city\
the fabrication makes us angry\
you promised us too much\
there's scalpel-poked holes in our dreams\

you're superficial, pornography-based\
with a plastic, flat face and\
valleys that lie between silicone tits\
at the Beverly Hills Hotel\
looking down at Hollywood's hell,\
that guts its residents dead with smears of pink\
blood, dying the stars on the walk of shame\
they all wanted to be shiny and true\
yet you see them as martyrs\
with latex skin from your penthouse view

so we moved to farms and cold places, still picking pimples\
primping to arch our backs\
craving the Justin Bieber pasta at Il Pastaio\
and a Brazilian bikini wax\
we wonder if you're our mirror,\
of society's innermost desires\
strung through the Sunset Strip\
playing Toxic on loop\
maybe that's why we hate you so much\
maybe you're just a response to us

who wouldn't want to be Lindsey Lohan,\
20 and pretty\
name-dropping, fame-clawing\
staying at the Chateau Marmont?

we have a proposition,\
(but please don't photo shop it):\
wrap our wounds in sequins,\
we'll trade out our kitten heels for six-inches\
and drunk cry on the fourth of July in Malibu\
just please keep the clubs open past two
