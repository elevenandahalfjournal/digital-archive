To come from mothers womb, is to tie an infrangible\
knot\
that hangs above a love ridden river, infinitely driven by its downward slope.

The water rushes down with subtle sound and gives life to the soil-bodies softly\
accepting its gifts.\
The river doesn't think twice,\
it can't help but flow down and the soil doesn't realize how she turns its life around,\
until the dry season begins.

When the love which once flowed needs a different kind of space to occupy;\
it's the love for her life that takes her to the sky, because how the change can not\
change - we know this is true in one way it could be the devastating truth.

But what the soil tells the sky by the cracks of being dry, is mother,\
please cry from your new distant sky and shower your changed-loving-all abundant eye,\
because now that we've reformed we have more room to grow\
and I can't wait to show all the seeds I will grow,\
but what you must not forget is it's your love falling down\
a simple long distant mile\
that is growing these trees, which will stay for a while.

As the very thing that breathes life into me, I love you as we; but now you and me.
