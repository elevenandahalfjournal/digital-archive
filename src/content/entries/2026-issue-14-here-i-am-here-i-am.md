It came as it did for Abraham,,,,,,,,,,\
In the muted hour,\
Weeding between Lamb or lake\
Lamb or ram\
Your son\
My mother\
In the corner gripping the rosary.

An omen for the bomb\
Buried in my gut.\
The nurse will find it or the soul will burn\
There is no choice\
The son shall burn.\
The body will rot

Under\
an overhead LED that is white but feels yellow\
Because\
You are not alone.

In a still, small voice that follows the wind,\
To die, or to trust\
There is no choice.\
It will call You to the mountain,\
You have never climbed before,\
That You shall climb again,\
I will climb again\
Beckoning You\
Take up on the wood\
Put it on Your son\
Put it on My limbs

Organs gnawing their way out of the soft-bellied stomach Eyes like a flame of fire\
You are not alone.

I am seventeen\
Leaking out bile On that durable cotton-polyester blend\
Why does it smell like a hospital

On Your hands\
Your eyes\
They do not form tears\
because they are\
not eyes\
They are\
not eyes\
But the lamp of the body

Shit is pouring like rain, the windows are black\
I just learned about the rapture\
This is not the rapture

Under\
an overhead LED that is white but feels yellow\
because You are not alone.

This is what it looks like right before,,,\
Right before\
You You\
You hear it before the blunder\
I will hear it before the blunder\
You are not alone.\
You are not alone.

The angel will call out to the raised arm,\
Veins\
Bursting, swollen and gargantuan\
Scars\
From the needles in the forearm\
Raised arm\
They rest there like stamps, pagans, like the scriptures, That's!\
An omen!\
Before Jesus\
Comes\
Take instead the ram

There is none to harm There is none to harm\
There is none to harm To harm

In a still, small voice,\
There is none\
To harm

I swear by myself\
As the stars in the sky and as\
The sand on the seashore

it\
will\
embrace\
you quietly,

Me\
You\
YouYouquietly\
Me quietlyquietly\
QuietlyandthenAndthen\

Andthenalland then all and then all\
at once.
