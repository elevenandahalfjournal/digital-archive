the fall brushes in with hands open and I begin to writhe from the shape of my jeans—\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;denim form compared to his and I imagine that I have been sent

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to take my own body off the world\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the sole reason of unpleasance and even a tug at some reincarnate edition\
there is an oracle in Tucson, Arizona and when winter pours over\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go with the undead of my closest family—\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less than half of them\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the Gallery in the Sun, I am in the image of god\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and still an aggravation on earth with my new name a pain and twinge\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the neck of a mother\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to recall that I am not at fault for the Virgin Mary's redemptive suffering

and we attempt to forget the redemptive suffering we have been told is ours to carry\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and we prayed to each other\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to see the edges of an exchanged body is known by how it is not\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who first spoke of me\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to let loose the grip of convention is\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a hand has been careful and has been sleeping against my ribs\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preceding admittance to a closer gleam

I will know more about you than you and you will know more about me than I know
