I grew fond of passing time alone\
And withered candles, dried with stones\
Smacking lips, that crackling pop\
Two steps each, trot by trot

Cigarette smoke, and oil drums\
I grew fond of each, I heard their hums\
They rattled through this empty space\
Mixing presence through their place

She whispered to me and went to sleep\
I dreamt of great things, and great retreats
