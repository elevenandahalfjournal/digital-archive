Tangled images, bags of soot, hanging down.\
A sinner crucified — in death,\
Purified.

The holy text of distortion painted across the wall.\
Illuminated only by the air's sweat and the heat of reflection.\
Light the fuel on fire, let the spores grow.\
Love it only in hatred of another.\
Feed the sacrificial lamb hollow grain.\
Purpose only in ceremony.\
Hallowed be thy name.

Resent the wickedly unwell.\
Envy the surface dwelling skin.\
The world wobbles for the hatred of sin.

Stare at the ceiling until it weeps bone marrow.\
Standing as Sebastian, love the arrow.\
Blood alleviating gravity, a man as white as leprosy thought to be beautiful.\
By the twisted vines wrapped around perception's perpetual present.

No truth in sight.\
The holy text drips.\
The shame resumes.\
The cycle restarts.

The root of the hatred — that of sin.\
Will never be found;\
Burning burnt skin.
