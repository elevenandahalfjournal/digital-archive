Here, before you

1\. , I will declare to you:\
2\. Say anything doubting me

I hate you all,\
And also declare–

Life is unfair, that certain demons\
Possess certain people less.\
And I will declare:\
People don't steal without necessity.\
And I will declare:\
That I am under you, that\
My demon looks up at yours\
And wishes to climb up and\
Possess more fruit. And this,\
I declare, this desire,\
Is not a sin, no, I declare\
I will eliminate every desire but to take from\
You.

But,\
You\
Will take my words\
And still keep your own reading\
As if you isn't you.

I will eat little, create lots

1\. To prove\
2\. For you, because

My demon is lower. and\
I will make a life of suffering,\
And I will climb, climb

1\. From\
2\. Like

Hell.\
You\
Will\
See me, grasping my

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1\. Thread<sup>1</sup>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2\. Words

To you.
