*at what frequency do you dissipate into?*\
*when karmic nirvana can be reached*\
*at the degree where the arch of a back feels safest*\
*when the image of emotion crawls back into its hole*\
*when regenerative trepidation kicks down your front door*\
*when the invocation cries into the ether*\
*where will you lay down when time falls flat on its ass?*\
*watching millennia pass molting to glycerin*\
*how will you cope with the disintegration of your conscious?*\
*cope with the disintegration of all that surrounds*\
*cope while intimacy latches to weaponization*\
*i weaponize my corporeal ego*\
*in flicks and kicks*\
*and high skirt slits*\
*can you fuck the shit out of life?*\
*does life fuck the shit out of you?*\
*do you wrap your tongue around its wet insides?*\
*does it shove its forearm down your throat?*\
*do you dig your nails into its supple underbelly?*\
*does it mount the force of sapience deep into your loins?*\
*i mount it and it feels so fucking good*
