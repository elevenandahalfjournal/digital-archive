I got baptized on my\
walk to school today

A pigeon swooped down\
must've been too cocky &\
confident in his vision\
for He brushed the top of my hair\
with the tip of his wing

He brought the clouds down\
with him, those greys\
that briefly nuzzled in the\
nest of my hair

"Cheerio"\
He might've chirped\
but He didn't stop to\
chat\
He had places to be

So I was left standing there\
Baffled\
from my brush with Grace
